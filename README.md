# RFAE
> The primary objective of feature selection is to consistently identify an optimal feature subset that either faithfully represents the entire dataset or demonstrates superior performance in downstream tasks. Presently, deep learning-based feature selectors frequently exhibit inadequate robustness. As a remedy, this endeavor incorporates a dual-pathway mechanism for comprehensive feature selection optimization and local redundancy elimination and culminates in the creation of a high-robust feature selector, referred to as Robust Fractal Autoencoders (RFAE). This innovative approach encompasses three pivotal enhancements: 1) Novel utilization of weight exponentiation to rectify the concern of FAE selecting a reduced number of features than designated. 2) Adoption of a dynamic and tailored strategy to optimize feature selection weights during the training process. 3) Introduction of a optional classification module, facilitating extension to supervised feature selection scenarios. We conducted experiments on a synthetic dataset, GEO gene dataset, and 14 common datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
